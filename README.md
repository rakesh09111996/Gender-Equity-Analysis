# Exploratory Data Analysis on Gender Equity in Data science Domain
## Objective
Understanding the gender inequity in Data science related domain work.

## Data set
Dataset is collected from the [Kaggle_2022_survey_Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kaggle-survey-2022) Based on that Gender Equity Analysis on Data science Domain related jobs is performed. Analysis done based on the below variables alone in the survey,
Age, Gender, Country, Student, Degree, Programming years, Compensation

We could see very large amount student is Man and the amount of woman in the student category is very less and there is high correlation between gender and being student.

Here the correlation is slightly less strong. L- Low, M- -below medium, M+ -Above medium, H – High compensation.  The size of each box represents the amount in each category. From Low to High compensation the width of Doc increases shows that relatively a greater number of people have a Doctorate in the High compensation category.

From the above graph, we can infer that the income distribution is different for different countries. And in high and in above medium-income groups we could see predominantly the Male population in most of the countries while in low income the distribution seems to be invariant of gender in most countries. Even in developed countries like Germany and France the male population mostly takes the high-income position.

Mostly the bachelor's, master's, and doctorate have equal participation between gender types, which shows that opportunity for education is mostly accessible to females also.

Mostly the distribution is similar between genders except few outliers and it shows that compensation doesn’t depend on programming experience.

## Observation
Access to education has increased, but still at workspace particulary in high paying jobs the male population is far higher than the female population.

# Conclusion
From the above analysis we could conclude that the possibility of being a student is higher for males and also mostly male population takes the high or above medium income position which clearly shows discrimination towards females, this shows that even in developed countries there is an income disparity between gender and gender equity in-terms of income still need to be attained in many countries.
